The purpose of this project was to create an employee payroll tracker so that I can see my employee's payroll data, which will allow me to budget for the company. 

On this page, you can select the "add employees" blue button which will prompt you to enter a first name, last name and salary of each employee. Once these three pieces of information are entered, you can either choose to add another employee by selecting "OK," or select "Cancel" if you do not wish to add another. After entering the information, you will see that a table has been created with what you entered, separated into categories. If you right click on the page and select "inspect" then select "console," you will see the average employee salary. In addition, you will see that a random employee has been selected as the winner for a random drawing. 

While completing this challenge, I learned multiple different aspects of Javascript. This includes how to use an isNaN function, how to write a while loop and how to use prompt and confirm to create interactive pop-ups. I also learned how to display an average and use the built in Math object to create random number generation.
